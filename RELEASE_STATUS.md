# Release preparation: 0.4.2

The Journal's road-so-far charts drop badges, which are complete within the first day, for level
100 species and perfect finds, read from the same `pokedex-milestones-v1` record the Pokédex
shows. The `progress` table gains nullable `level100` and `perfect` columns, added on open; a row
is written in the transaction that stores a milestone change, carrying the game's own counts from
the previous row. 0.4.1 ignores the new columns. The Pokédex loses its "About these counts" panel.

## What was verified

1,335 Python tests pass (67 skipped), plus 76 JavaScript tests and 18 browser tests. New tests
cover a row following each level 100 or perfect-find change and not otherwise, no row before an
adventure's first, the long goals carried through later journal rows, and a 0.4.0 table gaining
the columns empty.

The release targets are a Python wheel and source archive, plus a Linux amd64 Docker image and
Compose configuration. The `pokesim-desktop` Python command opens the Library in your browser.

Publication is gated on Python and browser regression checks, clean package identities, Docker
lifecycle checks, and isolated native Python installations on Windows x86-64, Intel macOS, Apple
Silicon, and Linux x86-64 and ARM64. The workflow uploads a draft, verifies every uploaded
checksum, and only then publishes it.

Publishing this release does not upgrade a running application: change the image or package where
it is deployed. See [release notes](docs/release-notes.md),
[desktop installation](docs/desktop.md), and [self-hosting](docs/self-hosting.md).

## Known limits, deliberately not addressed here

- **Recovery never gives up.** An exchange that cannot be finished is retried forever, now slowly.
  A ceiling would mean abandoning an exchange already committed on one side, which is the one
  path that can actually lose a Pokémon. It needs a design and a test, not a constant. Until
  then, a permanently stuck exchange still freezes stop, archive, edit and backup for that pair,
  and the only exit is to resolve whatever the recovery is failing on.
- **The commit path still holds `self.guard` across the two stage calls**, up to 55 seconds each,
  so a cancel that arrives during staging waits for them. That ordering is deliberate: a cancel
  must not race a commit.
- **The scheduler's candidate search is still quadratic** in offers, and re-runs from scratch every
  ten seconds, though each combination is now cheap: about 0.2 s per pair of full libraries.
- **The bundled broker Compose file serves an unauthenticated endpoint on 0.0.0.0** and returns
  full inventories, and that endpoint is expensive to compute. The broker is optional and is not
  part of the Library deployment; do not expose it beyond a trusted network.
- **Journal screenshots already stored blank are not repaired**, including the one in the shipped
  Journal image. Only new entries are retaken.
- **Seen counts, level 100 species and perfect finds have no backfill.** Journal entries never
  recorded them, so their history starts with 0.4.0 (seen) and 0.4.2 (the other two).
- **Hall of Fame teams still do not rotate.** A rematch fights with whichever six remain in the
  party. Choosing a varied team is a gameplay change that needs its own endurance run.
- **Legacy per-entry rewind states are kept** (about 24 MB for the busiest adventure). They stopped
  growing in an earlier release and are what lets an old Journal entry rewind.
- **No formatter or type checker.** Ruff runs the Pyflakes rules only, and 15% of functions carry
  return annotations.

Gameplay remains an experimental beta. Synthetic tests, a single mature-save replay and
demonstration-ROM worker checks do not establish uninterrupted multi-day cartridge gameplay on
all platforms. Existing private gameplay and cable-trading receipts retain their original scope.
Back up the complete library before upgrading. Import legacy adventures into a new application
folder with the old application stopped.

[Historical release and deployment records](docs/history/releases-through-rc31.md) remain
available for earlier version receipts and their limitations.
